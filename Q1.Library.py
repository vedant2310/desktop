Algorithm: Library Borrowing System

Start

Initialize lists for books, borrow_counts, and members.

Display a menu with options for average, highest/lowest, non-borrowers, mode, and exit.

If user selects option 1, calculate average = sum(members) / total_members and display it.

If option 2, find maximum and minimum values in borrow_counts and display corresponding books.

If option 3, count members with borrow count = 0 and display the result.

If option 4, find the mode of borrow_counts and display the corresponding book.

If option 5, exit the program.

Display error message for invalid choices.

Repeat steps 3â€“9 until user exits.

Stop
