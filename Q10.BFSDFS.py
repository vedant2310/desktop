Algorithm: Graph Traversal using BFS and DFS

Start with a set of popular locations (A, B, C, â€¦) as nodes of a graph.

Represent the routes between locations as edges connecting nodes.

Create an Adjacency List for performing BFS.

Create an Adjacency Matrix for performing DFS.

Choose a starting node (say, A).

For BFS:

-Initialize a queue and a visited list.

-Visit the start node, enqueue it, and mark as visited.

-Repeatedly dequeue a node, visit all unvisited adjacent nodes, and enqueue them.

For DFS:

-Use recursion or a stack with the adjacency matrix.

-Visit the starting node, mark as visited.

-Recursively visit all its unvisited adjacent nodes.

Display the order of traversal for both BFS and DFS.

End.
